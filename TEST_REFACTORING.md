# Test Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

Successfully refactored `tests/test_random_loads.py` to remove optional imports and skipif decorators.

### Before
```python
try:
    from topopt.problems import MBBBeam
    from topopt.filters import DensityFilter
    from topopt.guis import NullGUI
    from topopt.solvers import (...)
    TOPOPT_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError as e:
    TOPOPT_AVAILABLE = False
    IMPORT_ERROR = str(e)

@pytest.mark.skipif(not TOPOPT_AVAILABLE, reason="topopt not available")
class TestLoadDistributionSampling:
    ...
```

### After
```python
from topopt.problems import MBBBeam
from topopt.filters import DensityFilter
from topopt.guis import NullGUI
from topopt.solvers import (...)

class TestLoadDistributionSampling:
    ...
```

## What Changed

✅ **Removed conditional imports**: Now imports are required, not optional
✅ **Removed skipif decorators**: All 4 test classes now run unconditionally
✅ **Removed try/except**: No error handling for missing imports
✅ **Removed TOPOPT_AVAILABLE flag**: No longer needed

## Result

- Tests are **now required to run** - not skipped if imports fail
- Any import errors will **fail the test suite** (which is correct behavior)
- **Simple, clean imports** at the top of the file
- **All 13 test cases** now run without conditions

## Test Classes Affected

1. ✅ `TestLoadDistributionSampling` - 5 tests
2. ✅ `TestBetaRandomLoadFunction` - 3 tests
3. ✅ `TestBetaSolverRandomLoads` - 3 tests
4. ✅ `TestComparisonWithBaseBeta` - 1 test

**Total: 13 tests now required (not optional)**

## Philosophy

If tests are broken due to missing imports or other issues, the test suite should **fail loudly**, not silently skip. This ensures:
- Problems are caught immediately
- Dependencies are clearly documented in test requirements
- No hidden test failures due to import issues
- Clear feedback on what needs to be fixed

**Status**: ✅ Refactoring Complete
